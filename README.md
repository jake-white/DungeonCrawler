DungeonCrawler
==============

Description: Noobish 2D First-person dungeon crawler. Awful map editing and management, trying to squeeze out a small 41-room dungeon I have designed using pen & paper.

Done:
Basic rendering
Turning/walking forward/backwards
Found/converted music files for battle, boss battle, and general dungeon soundtrack.


To Do:
Map out dungeon
Implement lever-open-door scenario
    Find/make images of lever and door, figure out how to display those BufferedImage .pngs in context
Implement turn-based battle System
    Implement random encounters
    Find/make enemies and images
    Implement final boss
Music - use Java Clips
    Sound effects for walking/battling?
Implement colors/lighting/textures? (on walls/ceiling/floor, make render-depth-darkness smoother and make sense)
