Description: Noobish 2D First-person dungeon crawler.

Awful map editing and management, trying to squeeze out a small 41-room dungeon I have designed using pen & paper.

Done:

    Basic rendering

    Turning/walking forward/backwards

    Found/converted music files for battle, boss battle, and general dungeon soundtrack.

    Added corner rendering for left/right empty walls
    
    Added sound effects for walking/turning
    
    Added background music
    
    Added lighting (shades of grey/black in reference to the player)
    
    Completed mapping!
    
    Added gate & key system with BufferedImages
    
    Added "inventory" -- at this point, only for the key -- that displays in a sidebar
    
    Added turn-based battle system
    
    Added enemy images
    
    Added speed
    
    Added exp/leveling system and stats viewer


To Do:

        Add luck?
    
        Implement final boss

        Sound effects for battling
